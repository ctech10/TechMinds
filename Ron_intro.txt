Name: Ron Ochakovsky
About me: I like to read books before going to sleep and I keep track of good habits, in addition I exercise in the gym 3 times a week and I like robotics (I did some small projects on Arduino and I really enjoyed it).
Fun fact: I had once an exam in my academic studies and after re-checking my answers like 5 times at least, I got a mistake and it was a math mistake and the exam was American style, from this day and till now I hate American style exams.
I live in Rishon leZion (Israel)
